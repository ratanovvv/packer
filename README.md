# Prerequisites
- Use [this instruction](https://nickcharlton.net/posts/using-packer-esxi-6.html) to build on esxi host. Duplicate is below.
## Configuring the ESXi Host
Our ESXi host needs a little bit of configuration to allow Packer to work. Packer communicates over SSH, so first we need to open that. Secondly, weâ€™ll enable an option to discover Guest IPs from the Host and then finally allow VNC connections remotely.
### Enable SSH
Inside the web UI, navigate to "Manage", then the "Services" tab. Find the entry called: "TSM-SSH", and enable it.

You may wish to enable it to start up with the host by default. You can do this inside the "Actions" dropdown (it's nested inside "Policy").
### Enable "Guest IP Hack"
Run the following command on the ESXi host:
`esxcli system settings advanced set -o /Net/GuestIPHack -i 1`
This allows Packer to infer the guest IP from ESXi, without the VM needing to report it itself.
### Open VNC Ports on the Firewall
Packer connects to the VM using VNC, so we'll [open a range of ports](https://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/search.do?language=en_US&cmd=displayKC&externalId=2008226) to allow it to connect to it.

First, ensure we can edit the firewall configuration:
```bash
chmod 644 /etc/vmware/firewall/service.xml
chmod +t /etc/vmware/firewall/service.xml
```
Then append the range we want to open to the end of the file:
```xml
<service id="1000">
  <id>packer-vnc</id>
  <rule id="0000">
    <direction>inbound</direction>
    <protocol>tcp</protocol>
    <porttype>dst</porttype>
    <port>
      <begin>5900</begin>
      <end>6000</end>
    </port>
  </rule>
  <enabled>true</enabled>
  <required>true</required>
</service>
```
Finally, restore the permissions and reload the firewall:
```bash
chmod 444 /etc/vmware/firewall/service.xml
esxcli network firewall refresh
```

# Create Packer template

### Choose template

There are two templates.
One with hetwork enabled and one without any - **dhcp** and **local** directories.
The one with network is prefered, because vm-tools are installed and ssh is enabled already.
To install with network you need distributed portgroup with ephemeral port binding.
Otherwise there will be no carrier on interface.

### SSH Private Key

Clone.
Provide **id_rsa** private key.
```bash
git clone --single-branch --branch centos-vmware-iso https://github.com/ratanovvv/packer.git
cd packer/dhcp
cp /path/to/private/key/id_rsa ./
```

### centos7ks.json

Customize ssh rsa public key and passwords in **centos7ks.json**.
I used password "password". To encrypt passwords use this command:
```bash
python -c 'import crypt,getpass;pw=getpass.getpass();print(crypt.crypt(pw) if (pw==getpass.getpass("Confirm: ")) else exit())'
```


### vars.json

customize **vars.json** file with appropriate vcenter credentials and ssh username

### Run

Deploy template with packer

```bash
PACKER_LOG=1 packer build -var-file=vars.json centos7.json
```
